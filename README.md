This repository contains Python code that demonstrates Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms on a tree data structure represented as a Python dictionary.

## Usage
To use the code, simply copy and paste it into a Python file or Jupyter Notebook and run it. The code will print the results of the DFS and BFS algorithms on the tree.

## Example
The code includes an example tree represented as a Python dictionary. You can modify this dictionary to represent your own tree.

## Data Structure
The tree is represented using a dictionary where keys represent nodes, and values are lists of their children.

## Algorithms
The code implements DFS using recursion and BFS using a queue.

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please submit an issue or pull request.
